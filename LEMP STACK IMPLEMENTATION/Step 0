Step 0 – Preparing prerequisites
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account – go back to Project 1 Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of t2.nano family with 
Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you STOP the ones you are not working with at 
the moment to save available free hours.

Hint: In previous project we used Putty on Windows to connect to our EC2 Instance, but there is a simpler way that do not require 
conversion of .pem key to .ppk – using Git Bash.

Download and install Git Bash like it is shown in this video.

Launch Git Bash and run following command:


```
ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>
```

It will look like this:
